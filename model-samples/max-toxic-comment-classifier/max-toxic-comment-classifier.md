## Overview

This model is able to detect 6 types of toxicity in a text fragment. The six detectable types are toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate. The underlying neural network is based on the [pre-trained BERT-Base, English Uncased model](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/README.md) and was finetuned on the [Toxic Comment Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data) using the [Huggingface BERT Pytorch repository](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT).

A brief definition of the six different toxicity types can be found below.

```
Toxic: very bad, unpleasant, or harmful

Severe toxic: extremely bad and offensive

Obscene: (of the portrayal or description of sexual matters) offensive or disgusting by accepted standards of morality and decency

Threat: a statement of an intention to inflict pain, injury, damage, or other hostile action on someone in retribution for something done or not done

Insult: speak to or treat with disrespect or scornful abuse

Identity hate: hatred, hostility, or violence towards members of a race, ethnicity, nation, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other designated sector of society
```

## Benchmark

This model achieves a column-wise ROC AUC score of 0.98355 (private score) in the [Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge). This implementation is trained with a maximum sequence length of 256 instead of 512 to have higher inference speed. For most applications outside of this Kaggle competition, a sequence length of 256 is more than sufficient.

## Options available for deploying this model

This model can be deployed using the following mechanisms:

* Run with Docker:
  ```
  docker run -it -p 5000:5000 codait/max-toxic-comment-classifier
  ```

* Deploy on Red Hat OpenShift:

  Follow the instructions for the OpenShift web console or the OpenShift Container Platform CLI in [this tutorial](https://github.ibm.com/IBMCode/Code-Tutorials/blob/e29a33f/deploy-a-model-asset-exchange-microservice-on-red-hat-openshift/index.md) and specify `codait/max-toxic-comment-classifier` as the image name.

* Deploy on Kubernetes:
  ```
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/MAX-Toxic-Comment-Classifier/master/max-toxic-comment-classifier.yaml
  ```

## Example Usage

You can test or use this model
 - [using cURL](#test-the-model-using-curl)
 - [in a serverless app](#test-the-model-in-a-serverless-app)

### Test the model using cURL

Once deployed, you can test the model from the command line. For example:

```
curl -d "{ \"text\": [ \"I would like to punch you.\", \"In hindsight, I do apologize for my previous statement.\" ]}" -X POST "http://localhost:5000/model/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

You should see a JSON response like that below:

```json

  "status": "ok",
  "predictions": [
    {
      "toxic": 0.9796434044837952,
