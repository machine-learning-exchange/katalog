## Overview

Project CodeNet is a large-scale dataset with approximately 14 million code samples, each of which is an intended solution to one of 4000 coding problems. The code samples are obtained from downloading submissions from two online judge web sites: [AIZU Online Judge](https://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/) and [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/). The code samples are written in over 50 programming languages (although the dominant languages are C++, C, Python, and Java) and they are annotated with a rich set of information, such as its code size, memory footprint, cpu run time, and status, which indicates acceptance or error types. The dataset is accompanied by a [repository](https://github.com/IBM/Project_CodeNet), where we provide a set of [tools](https://github.com/IBM/Project_CodeNet/tree/main/tools) to aggregate codes samples based on user criteria and to transform code samples into token sequences, simplified parse trees and other code graphs. A detailed discussion of Project CodeNet is available in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12655).

The rich annotation of Project CodeNet enables research in code search, code completion, code-code translation, and a myriad of other use cases. We also extracted several language specific datasets for benchmarking in Python, Java and C++ to drive innovation in deep learning and machine learning models in code classification and code similarity. To expedite AI for code research using graph neural networks, we also made available the simplified parse tree (SPT) representation of the code samples in the four benchmark datasets.

## Use the Dataset

This dataset is complemented by a collection of data exploration and data 
analysis Python notebooks to help you get started:

### Notebook 1: Project CodeNet Language Classification 

This notebook takes you through the steps of a simple experiment that shows how to create and exercise a Keras model to detect the language of a piece of source code. 

[Get the notebook](https://github.com/CODAIT/project-codenet-notebooks/blob/main/Project_CodeNet_LangClass.ipynb)

### Notebook 2: A Masked Language Model for Project CodeNet

This experiment investigates whether a popular attention model to construct a masked language model (MLM) can be used for source code instead of natural language sentences.
